<p>Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol. Puppeteer runs headless by default, but can be configured to run full (non-headless) Chrome or Chromium.</p>
<br>

## What puppeteer can do
<p>Most things that you can do manually in the browser can be done using Puppeteer! Here are a few examples to get you started:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Generate screenshots and PDFs of pages.</li>
  <li>Crawl a SPA (Single-Page Application) and generate pre-rendered content (i.e. "SSR" (Server-Side Rendering)).</li>
  <li>Automate form submission, UI testing, keyboard input, etc.</li>
  <li>Create an up-to-date, automated testing environment. Run your tests directly in the latest version of Chrome using the latest JavaScript and browser features.</li>
  <li>Capture a timeline trace of your site to help diagnose performance issues.</li>
  <li>Test Chrome Extensions.</li>
</ol>
